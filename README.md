# Virtual Comments Extension for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
The Virtual Comments Extension for Visual Studio Code is a tool designed to help developers with efficient code documentation when traditional JavaScript comments are not feasible.

## Problem Statement
- Code commenting plays a crucial role in ensuring the long-term maintainability and understanding of code, especially in a growing codebase like Milo.
- In Milo, we only use comments when really necessary to keep our JavaScript files smaller for faster browser downloads.
- Comments are not automatically trimmed from the files since Milo does not come with a build system.
- Virtual comments â€“ solution to solve this problem!

## Features

- **Efficient Documentation**: Improve your code's readability without adding traditional comments that may affect page performance.

- **Virtual Comments**: Add virtual comments to your code using CodeLenses, making it easier for you and your team to understand your codebase.

- **Interactive Comments**: Click on a virtual comment to update or delete the associated comment and its details.

- **Non-Intrusive**: Virtual comments do not impact your code's runtime behavior, ensuring your project remains efficient.

- **Dynamic line changing**: Virtual comments also offer a solution when the existing lines of code are moved, updated or deleted in the file.
